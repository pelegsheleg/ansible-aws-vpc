a vpc set up with a secure ec2 instance 
A bastion host is a server that is designed to provide secure access to a private network from an external network such as the internet. It acts as an intermediary server between the public network and the private network, providing a controlled and monitored point of entry.

Bastion hosts are typically used in situations where an organization needs to provide secure access to its internal resources, such as databases, web servers, or other applications. Instead of exposing these resources directly to the internet, the organization can use a bastion host to control access and enforce security policies.

VPC enables you to create a logically isolated network environment that allows you to control network settings, security, and access.
Customizable IP Addressing: You can specify IP addresses for your VPC, subnets, and network interfaces, giving you more control over your network.
Security: You can configure security groups and network ACLs to control traffic to and from your instances and resources.
High Availability: You can spread resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region for increased availability and fault tolerance.
Connectivity: You can connect your VPC to other VPCs, on-premises data centers, or remote networks using VPN or Direct Connect.
